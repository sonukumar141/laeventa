<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laeventa provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.laeventa.com (the "Website"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Website. By using the Website and/ or by providing your information, you consent to the collection and use of the information you disclose on the Website in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to your consent for sharing your information as per this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Laeventa Terms of Service, accessible at www.laeventa.com/terms/.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As used in this Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within India or internationally if any.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h5><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Website, services, features and content, to administer your use of our offering (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Website.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h5><strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></h5>
</li>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to create a Listing or make a booking, you must register via the Website to create an Account/Event. When you (i) register with us through the Website to become a Venue Owner or User, (ii) choose to add information to your profile webpage or (iii) create a Listing, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, company name (if applicable), phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and Venue postal addresses, as applicable. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may register to use the Services directly via the Website or by logging into your account via the Website, as described herein. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of such personal information about you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration, creation of Listings and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Laeventa Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Laeventa newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. Log Data. When you visit the Website, whether you have registered via the Website as a Venue Owner or User or are a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a "Laeventa User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the website meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information unless we use it in association with other Personal Information. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</span></li>
</ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h5><strong>COOKIES</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Website. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by Laeventa Users and web traffic routing on the Website. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Website and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Website may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website or all functionality of the Services.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h5><strong>EMAILING VIA A Laeventa ACCOUNT</strong></h5>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Services, Members and Venue Owners may communicate with each other through the use of their Accounts. Where a Member or Venue Owner has selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Website to those email addresses on their behalf.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h5><strong>PHISHING</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Laeventa. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Account login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</span></p>

<h5><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong></h5>

As a Member, if you request a Venue Visit, request a Venue Booking Fee quote or make a booking via the Services, we may share your name, phone number and email address with the applicable Venue Owner in order to fulfill your request or booking, as applicable. Bookings- If you make a booking of a Venue via the Services, we will share your Personal Information, including, but not limited to, your name and email address, as well as other information about your booking, (e.g. the number of attendees, the type of event) with the applicable Venue Owner so that such Venue Owner can coordinate the booking with you. Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information- We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</span></p>
